# guess-game
A game created with R

### How it works
* You are presented with a couple of numbers
* You have 3 attempts to guess the correct number
* If you guess correctly you move to the next level with more numbers.
* If at any point (level) you guess incorrectly after 3 attempts, you are out!
Enjoy :)
